So hello there!

My name is Theodoritos Bizmpianos and I ended up with something reasonable 
to show you, even though I didn't have nearly enough time to flesh it out
in the past days and I was working during the weekend.

There are two things that remain be done:

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!                                                                           !!
!!   1)The markers on the map aren't working.                                !!
!!   expect a commit with a new Map.jsx that fixes it, probably tomorrow     !!
!!                                                                           !!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!                                                                           !!
!!   2) There isn't any sorting done though of course I get the position     !!
!!   from the browser and I haven't really parsed the JSON                   !!
!!   as is. I've named the elements. I should just make a better parser,     !!
!!   probably in its own class. Again, expect commits.                       !!
!!                                                                           !!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Dependancies appart from react:

React Tiget Transitions - pedrobern.github.io/react-tiger-transition
!!  React-Google-Maps - https://github.com/tomchentw/react-google-maps  !!

React-Google-Maps's previously working syntax from another project is the problem,
so possibly there will be another dependancy here. 

Other than that, I used tiger for the first time and it is really cool.
