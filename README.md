So hello there!

My name is Theodoritos Bizmpianos and I ended up with something reasonable 
to share with you, even though I didn't have nearly enough time to flesh it out
in the past days. This took me about 3 hours total to put together. Having
2 jobs and working on the weekends isn't fun.

There are two things that remain to be done:

1)The markers on the map aren't working.                                
expect a commit with a new Map.jsx that fixes it, probably tomorrow     

2)There isn't any sorting done though of course I get the position     
from the browser and I haven't really parsed the JSON                   
as is. I've named the table of elements. I should just make a better parser,     
probably in its own class, or use JSON.parse(). Again, expect commits.                       

Dependancies appart from react:

React Tiget Transitions - pedrobern.github.io/react-tiger-transition
!!  React-Google-Maps - https://github.com/tomchentw/react-google-maps  !!

React-Google-Maps's previously working syntax (from anohther project I've used it in)
is the problem, so possibly there will be another dependancy here. 

Other than that, I used tiger for the first time and it is really cool.
